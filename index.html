			<p id="introPara"> On 1998, Janurary 3rd, the world changed forever. Sarah Mary Conway was born healthy, besides one asthma condition and an allergy to cats. Growing up in Toronto, Ontario her whole life, she became the tough gal she is today.  Figuring that she should put her internet addiction/computer to good use, she decided pursue a career in digital design while fighting the patriarchy.</p>

		<p id="detailPara">Sarah loves pasta, the song “The Real Slim Shady”, hoarding mugs, and feminism.  She always buys notebooks that she never writes in. Her phone case is really old. She can rap nicki minage’s verse in “Only” sickeningly. Sarah also uses a lot of terminology from Ru Paul’s Drag Race. Condragulations for her. Her dislikes include large birds, most exotics birds, seagulls, and the patriarchy. Also House Hunters, granite countertops, trucks, and country music. She has a commendable makeup collection, at least she thinks so. She’s ready to fight anyone at anytime and has a pretty cool flamingo light. Once, he drank two full bottles of wine in one night. Impressive. People in her neighbourhood call her Scone because like a scone, she’s awesome.</p>
